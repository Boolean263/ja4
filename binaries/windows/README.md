JA4+ is a suite of network fingerprinting methods.

## Nomenclature

Name | Meaning
--- | ---
JA4 | TLS client fingerprint
JA4S | TLS server fingerprint
JA4L-C/S | Light distance/location fingerprint
JA4H | HTTP client fingerprint
JA4SSH | SSH traffic fingerprint
JA4X | X.509 fingerprint

## Requirements

You must install tshark (wireshark.org) and add the folder for tshark to your system PATH
(System properties > Environment Variables... > Edit Path)

## Usage

```
Usage: ja4 [OPTIONS] <PCAP>

Arguments:
  <PCAP>
          The capture file to process

Options:
  -j, --json
          JSON output (default is YAML)

  -r, --with-raw
          Include raw (unhashed) fingerprints in the output

  -O, --original-order
          Preserve the original order of values.

          JA4 (TLS client): disable sorting of ciphers and TLS extensions.

          JA4H (HTTP client): disable sorting of headers and cookies.

      --keylog-file <KEYLOG_FILE>
          The key log file that enables decryption of TLS traffic.

          This file is generated by the browser when `SSLKEYLOGFILE` environment variable is set. See <https://wiki.wireshark.org/TLS#using-the-pre-master-secret> for more details.

          Note that you can embed the TLS key log file in a capture file: `editcap --inject-secrets tls,keys.txt in.pcap out-dsb.pcapng`

  -n, --with-packet-numbers
          Include packet numbers (`pkt_*` fields) in the output.

          This information is useful for debugging.

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -V, --version
          Print version
```
